# Running the program:
1. Open the program in the correct branch in VS Code. Right now, we are using the branch *main2*
2. To do this download the zip file from the *main2* branch 
3. extract the zip file and open the new folder in VS code
4. Run the *LaserTag.java* file. You will know if the program ran correctly if the splash screen image shows up.
5. When the splash screen automatically closes click on the new java window to see the player entry screen.
6. To end the player entry screen, press the *F3* key.
7. After pressing *F3*, the traffic generator will require input from the command line.
8. You will need to enter the ID number of 2 players for each team. (The command line will tell you what to enter exactly)
9. The traffic generator will also require an input of the number of events you want to happen.
10. After the number of events are entered a count-down timer will start along with the audio file
11. After the timer hits zero, the count-down timer will disappear and open the player action screen.
12. Once the player Action screen starts you should see the scores and text on screen actively change.
13. Another 6 minute count down timer will also be present once the player action screen starts
14. To close the program, press the *X* button on the player action window or on the count down window.
